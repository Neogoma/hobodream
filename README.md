## Presentation
Hobodream is a set of Unity tools created by Neogoma. The objective of this framework is to standardize behaviors between all our SDK's as well as all our projects.

This framework is useful if:
- You are looking for a quick implementation of an observer design pattern in unity
- You want a quick localization system
- You want an interface for networking operations that will be easy to handle
- You are using other Neogoma frameworks
